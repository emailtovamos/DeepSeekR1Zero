**DeepSeek R1 Zero Toy Model Training**

Install:
!pip install transformers datasets wandb tqdm
!pip install bitsandbytes
!wandb login --anonymously

Then run the code to train your own small DeepSeek R1 Zero from a small base model. The aim is to be able to run it in limited resources and over a smaller dataset.
